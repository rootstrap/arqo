# ARQO ![ARQO](docs/images/logo.png)

ARQO (Active Record Query Objects) is a minimal gem that let you use Query Objects in an easy and Rails friendly way. It leverages `ActiveRecord` features and tries to make query objects as intuitive as possible for developers. In combination with the documentation we hope `ARQO` helps people keep their projects well structured and healthy.
